used
 brew install postgres
 brew services start postgresql
 brew update
 brew install postgresql (gem install pg wouldn't work anyway)
  rvm use 2.7.0
 changed .ruby-version 2.7.0
 changed gemfile ruby to 2.7.0
 gem install pg
 rails new CardFight-backend --api --database=postgresql
 gem install nokogiri -v '1.6.2.1' | grep libxml

didn't work 

so then did 
xcode-select --install
gem install nokogiri
bundle install

 because nokogiri wouldn't install

 remember to look up event listeners
